          To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.
          I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
          
         <h3>Security</h3> 
          
          I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it.
